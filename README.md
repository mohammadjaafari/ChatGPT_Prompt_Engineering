# ChatGPT_Prompt_Engineering

The notebook attached portrays my ability to prompt engineer using ChatOpenAI model


#### Note

I am unable to use an API key of my own for OpenAI so i used the API key given by DeepLearning.AI during their short courses for experimentational free use. Hence, I can not leave the notebook environment or deploy my project on an integrative gui or website for demonstration or testing purposes or download the notebook. 

However, the code is safe to be run using your own API key.
